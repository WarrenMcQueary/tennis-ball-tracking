# tennis-ball-tracking
Tracks a tennis ball through a series of images at a known framerate, then produces plots of the tennis ball's position, velocity, and acceleration.

I do not own the video used in this code.  Credit to the original [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIRqYz_hnkQ).

This script inputs a series of frames from a video of a tennis ball bouncing several times off of a table, and outputs the tennis ball's vertical position, velocity, and acceleration as functions of time.
